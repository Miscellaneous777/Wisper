## Welcome to Wisper!

This is a quick game I'm making to fiddle around with Godot and pixel art :)

I hope you like it! :D

## Current features:

 * None!

## Planned features:

- [x] **Create player sprite :raising_hand_man:** - This is a key step for any game.
- [ ] **Create basic background sprites :leaves:** - We need something for the player to walk on, after all
- [ ] **Create health + energy/mana systems :heart::dizzy:** - What's a player without a heart? :)
- [ ] **Create first enemies :skull:** - What's a platformer with no conflict? :)
- [ ] **Create death screen** - Where's the challenge in immortality? :)
